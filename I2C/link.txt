MSP430G2xx3 Demo - USCI_B0 I2C Master RX single bytes from MSP430 Slave
    //
    //  Description: This demo connects two MSP430's via the I2C bus. The master
    //  reads from the slave. This is the master code. The data from the slave
    //  transmitter begins at 0 and increments with each transfer. The received
    //  data is in R5 and is checked for validity. If the received data is
    //  incorrect, the CPU is trapped and the P1.0 LED will stay on. The USCI_B0
    //  RX interrupt is used to know when new data has been received.
    //  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = BRCLK = default DCO = ~1.2MHz

Have you tried setting the pins to the required output/input setting? – Keelan Apr 29 '13 at 9:11
Of course, as i told you my circuit is as it's required. 1.7 to SDA and 1.6 to SCL, two 10K pull-up resistors on them. The wierd part is that these two examples are working seperately. But my code which i combined them is not working so I'm pretty sure that the problem is code based. – Bariscan Kayaoglu Apr 29 '13 at 9:22
Yes, but did you configure the pins as output/input? You should do that in the code, not in the circuit. – Keelan Apr 29 '13 at 9:25
I don't think that is required. Since these two pins are bus related, selecting them to USCI_B0 will do. P1SEL |= BIT6 + BIT7; // Assign I2C pins to USCI_B0 P1SEL2|= BIT6 + BIT7; // Assign I2C pins to USCI_B0 In TI's examples, they do exactly the same without any configuration on the pins except the selecting. – Bariscan Kayaoglu Apr 29 '13 at 9:29 
Me neither, but for SPI it is required on some controllers and I follow the rule "better just do it, then you're sure". But feel free to omit it, and let's just hope it doesn't work out bad for you. – Keelan Apr 29 '13 at 9:31
